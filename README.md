<br />

I'm [Bernard](https://bernwo.github.io/), a Master student in quantum computing who is also passionate about scientific programming and results visualisations. âœ¨

I have been doing scientific programming for over 4 years in various languages, i.e., `Python`, `Julia`, `Matlab`, `Mathematica`, `C++`.

Fun fact: I self-learned Python, then C++ in university.ðŸ˜†
